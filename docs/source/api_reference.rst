API Reference
=============

This section provides detailed information about the Project_GitHub API.

main module
-----------

.. automodule:: src.main
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

Note: The actual content of this API reference will depend on the functions and classes defined in your `src/main.py` file. As the project develops, you should update this file to include documentation for all public modules, classes, and functions.

To generate automatic API documentation, you'll need to:

1. Ensure your Python code is properly documented with docstrings.
2. Use the `autodoc` extension in Sphinx (which should be enabled in your `conf.py` file).
3. Run the Sphinx documentation build process.

Example Function Documentation
------------------------------

Here's an example of how a function in your `main.py` might be documented:

.. code-block:: python

   def example_function(param1, param2):
       """
       This function does X and returns Y.

       :param param1: Description of param1
       :type param1: type of param1
       :param param2: Description of param2
       :type param2: type of param2
       :return: Description of return value
       :rtype: return type
       """
       # Function implementation here

When you build the documentation, Sphinx will automatically generate API documentation based on your docstrings.

Remember to keep your API documentation up-to-date as you develop your project. Good documentation is crucial for the usability and maintainability of your code.
